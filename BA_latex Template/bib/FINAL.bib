abstract = {The growth of email users has resulted in the dramatic increasing of the spam emails during the past few years. In this paper, four machine learning algorithms, which are Na{\"{i}}ve Bayesian (NB), neural network (NN), support vector machine (SVM) and relevance vector machine (RVM), are proposed for spam classification. An empirical evaluation for them on the benchmark spam filtering corpora is presented. The experiments are performed based on different training set size and extracted feature size. Experimental results show that NN classifier is unsuitable for using alone as a spam rejection tool. Generally, the performances of SVM and RVM classifiers are obviously superior to NB classifier. Compared with SVM, RVM is shown to provide the similar classification result with less relevance vectors and much faster testing time. Despite the slower learning procedure, RVM is more suitable than SVM for spam classification in terms of the applications that require low complexity.},

@article{Mikolov,
abstract = {The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

For crossvalidation, we vary the number of folds and whether the folds are strati ed or not for bootstrap, we vary the number of bootstrap sam- ples. Our results indicate that for real-word datasets similar to ours, the best method to use for model selection is ten-fold strati ed cross validation, even if computation power allows using more folds.},

Even though there are many approaches to determining thresholds, there is no comparative study. In this paper, twelve approaches were compared using two species in Europe and artificial neural networks, and the modelling results were assessed using four indices: sensitivity, specificity, overall prediction success and Cohen's kappa statistic. The results show that prevalence approach, average predicted probability/suitability approach, and three sensitivity-specificity-combined approaches, including sensitivity-specificity sum maximization approach, sensitivity- specificity equality approach and the approach based on the shortest distance to the top-left corner (0,1) in ROC plot, are the good ones. The commonly used kappa maximization approach is not as good as the afore-mentioned ones, and the fixed threshold approach is the worst one. We also recommend using datasets with prevalence of 50{\%} to build models if possible since most optimization criteria might be satisfied or nearly satisfied at the same time, and therefore it's easier to find optimal thresholds in this situation.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\{}{\&}{\}} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

abstract = {Random Forest is an ensemble supervised machine learning technique. Machine learning techniques have applications in the area of Data mining. Random Forest has tremendous potential of becoming a popular technique for future classifiers because its performance has been found to be comparable with ensemble techniques bagging and boosting. Hence, an in-depth study of existing work related to Random Forest will help to accelerate research in the field of Machine Learning. This paper presents a systematic survey of work done in Random Forest area. In this process, we derived Taxonomy of Random Forest Classifier which is presented in this paper. We also prepared a Comparison chart of existing Random Forest classifiers on the basis of relevant parameters. The survey results show that there is scope for improvement in accuracy by using different split measures and combining functions; and in performance by dynamically pruning a forest and estimating optimal subset of the forest. There is also scope for evolving other novel ideas for stream data and imbalanced data classification, and for semi-supervised learning. Based on this survey, we finally presented a few future research directions related to Random Forest classifier.},

abstract = {There are three factors involved in text classification. These are classification model, similarity measure and document representation model. In this paper, we will focus on document representation and demonstrate that the choice of document representation has a profound impact on the quality of the classifier. In our experiments, we have used the centroid-based text classifier, which is a simple and robust text classification scheme. We will compare four different types of document representations: N-grams, Single terms, phrases and RDR which is a logic-based document representation. The N-gram representation is a string-based representation with no linguistic processing. The Single term approach is based on words with minimum linguistic processing. The phrase approach is based on linguistically formed phrases and single words. The RDR is based on linguistic processing and representing documents as a set of logical predicates. We have experimented with many text collections and we have obtained similar results. Here, we base our arguments on experiments conducted on Reuters-21578. We show that RDR, the more complex representation, produces more effective classifier on Reuters-21578, followed by the phrase approach. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Isa2008,
abstract = {This work implements an enhanced hybrid classification method through the utilization of the naive Bayes approach and the support vector machine (SVM). In this project, the Bayes formula was used to vectorize (as opposed to classify) a document according to a probability distribution reflecting the probable categories that the document may belong to. The Bayes formula gives a range of probabilities to which the document can be assigned according to a predetermined set of topics (categories) such as those found in the "20 Newsgroups" data set for instance. Using this probability distribution as the vectors to represent the document, the SVM can then be used to classify the documents on a multidimensional level. The effects of an inadvertent dimensionality reduction caused by classifying using only the highest probability using the naive Bayes classifier can be overcome using the SVM by employing all the probability values associated with every category for each document. This method can be used for any data set and shows a significant reduction in training time as compared to the Lsquare method and significant improvement in the classification accuracy when compared to pure naive Bayes systems and also the TF-IDF/SVM hybrids.},

@article{Oshiro2012,
abstract = {Random Forest is a computationally efficient technique that can operate quickly over large datasets. It has been used in many recent research projects and real-world applications in diverse domains. However, the associated literature provides almost no directions about how many trees should be used to compose a Random Forest. The research reported here analyzes whether there is an optimal number of trees within a Random Forest, i.e., a threshold from which increasing the number of trees would bring no significant performance gain, and would only increase the computational cost. Our main conclusions are: as the number of trees grows, it does not always mean the performance of the forest is significantly better than previous forests (fewer trees), and doubling the number of trees is worthless. It is also possible to state there is a threshold beyond which there is no significant gain, unless a huge computational environment is available. In addition, it was found an experimental relationship for the AUC gain when doubling the number of trees in any forest. Furthermore, as the number of trees grows, the full set of attributes tend to be used within a Random Forest, which may not be interesting in the biomedical domain. Additionally, datasets' density-based metrics proposed here probably capture some aspects of the VC dimension on decision trees and low-density datasets may require large capacity machines whilst the opposite also seems to be true.},

Even though the learning ability and computational complexity of training in support vector machines may be independent of the dimension of the feature space, reducing computational complexity is an essential issue to effi- ciently handle a large number of terms in practical applications of text classification. In this paper, we adopt novel dimension reduction methods to reduce the dimension of the document vectors dramatically. We also introduce decision functions for the centroid-based classification algorithm and support vector classifiers to handle the classification problemwhere a documentmay belong to multiple classes. Our substantial experimental results show that with several dimension reduction methods that are designed particularly for clustered data, higher efficiency for both training and testing can be achieved without sacrificing prediction accuracy of text classification even when the dimension of the input space is significantly reduced},

@article{Wu2014,
abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new random forest (RF) based ensemble method, ForesTexter, to solve the imbalanced text categorization problems. RF has shown great success in many real-world applications. However, the problem of learning from text data with class imbalance is a relatively new challenge that needs to be addressed. A RF algorithm tends to use a simple random sampling of features in building their decision trees. As a result, it selects many subspaces that contain few, if any, informative features for the minority class. Furthermore, the Gini measure for data splitting is considered to be skew sensitive and bias towards the majority class. Due to the inherent complex characteristics of imbalanced text datasets, learning RF from such data requires new approaches to overcome challenges related to feature subspace selection and cut-point choice while performing node splitting. To this end, we propose a new tree induction method that selects splits, both feature subspace selection and splitting criterion, for RF on imbalanced text data. The key idea is to stratify features into two groups and to generate effective term weighting for the features. One group contains positive features for the minority class and the other one contains the negative features for the majority class. Then, for feature subspace selection, we effectively select features from each group based on the term weights. The advantage of our approach is that each subspace contains adequate informative features for both minority and majority classes. One difference between our proposed tree induction method and the classical RF method is that our method uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier to split the training data into smaller and more balance subsets at each tree node, and then successively retrains the SVM classifiers on the data partitions to refine the model while moving down the tree. In this way, we force the classifiers to learn from refined feature subspaces and data subsets to fit the imbalanced data better. Hence, the tree model becomes more robust for text categorization task with imbalanced dataset. Experimental results on various benchmark imbalanced text datasets (Reuters-21578, Ohsumed, and imbalanced 20 newsgroup) consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ForesTexter method. The performance of our proposed approach is competitive against the standard random forest and different variants of SVM algorithms. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Five meth- ods were evaluated, including term selection based on document frequency (DF), informa- tion gain (IG), mutual information (MI), a 2-test (CHI), and term strength (TS). We found IG and CHI most e ective in our ex- periments. Using IG thresholding with a k- nearest neighbor classi er on the Reuters cor- pus, removal of up to 98{\{}{\%}{\}} removal of unique terms actually yielded an improved classi - cation accuracy (measured by average preci- sion). DF thresholding performed similarly. Indeed we found strong correlations between the DF, IG and CHI values of a term. This suggests that DF thresholding, the simplest method with the lowest cost in computation, can be reliably used instead of IG or CHI when the computation of these measures are too expensive. TS compares favorably with the other methods with up to 50{\{}{\%}{\}} vocabulary reduction but is not competitive at higher vo- cabulary reduction levels. In contrast, MI had relatively poor performance due to its bias towards favoring rare terms, and its sen- sitivity to probability estimation errors.},

@article{Sebastiani2001,
abstract = {The automated categorization (or classification) of texts into predefined categories has witnessed a booming interest in the last ten years, due to the increased availability of documents in digital form and the ensuing need to organize them. In the research community the dominant approach to this problem is based on machine learning techniques: a general inductive process automatically builds a classifier by learning, from a set of preclassified documents, the characteristics of the categories. The advantages of this approach over the knowledge engineering approach (consisting in the manual definition of a classifier by domain experts) are a very good effectiveness, considerable savings in terms of expert manpower, and straightforward portability to different domains. This survey discusses the main approaches to text categorization that fall within the machine learning paradigm. We will discuss in detail issues pertaining to three different problems, namely document representation, classifier construction, and classifier evaluation.},

@article{McCallum1998a,
abstract = {Recent approaches to text classification have used two different first-order probabilistic models for classification, both of which make the naive Bayes assumption. Some use a multi-variate Bernoulli model, that is, a Bayesian Network with no dependencies between words and binary word features (e.g. Larkey and Croft 1996; Koller and Sahami 1997). Others use a multinomial model, that is, a uni-gram language model with integer word counts (e.g. Lewis and Gale 1994; Mitchell 1997). This paper aims to clarify the confusion by describing the differences and details of these two models, and by empirically comparing their classification performance on five text corpora. We find that the multi-variate Bernoulli performs well with small vocabulary sizes, but that the multinomial performs usually performs even better at larger vocabulary sizes—providing on average a 27{\%} reduction in error over the multi-variate Bernoulli model at any vocabulary size.

@article{Liu2017,
abstract = {Extreme multi-label text classiication (XMTC) refers to the prob-lem of assigning to each document its most relevant subset of class labels from an extremely large label collection, where the number of labels could reach hundreds of thousands or millions. huge label space raises research challenges such as data sparsity and scalability. Signiicant progress has been made in recent years by the development of new machine learning methods, such as tree induction with large-margin partitions of the instance spaces and label-vector embedding in the target space. However, deep learning has not been explored for XMTC, despite its big successes in other related areas. paper presents the aaempt at applying deep learning to XMTC, with a family of new Convolutional Neural Net-work (CNN) models which are tailored for multi-label classiication in particular. With a comparative evaluation of 7 state-of-the-art methods on 6 benchmark datasets where the number of labels is up to 670,000, we show that the proposed CNN approach successfully scaled to the largest datasets, and consistently produced the best or the second best results on all the datasets. On the Wikipedia dataset with over 2 million documents and 500,000 labels in partic-ular, it outperformed the second best method by 11.7{\%} ∼ 15.3{\%} in precision@K and by 11.5{\%} ∼ 11.7{\%} in NDCG@K for K = 1,3,5.},
